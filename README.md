# Control-Structures-and-Looping-Tasks
This coding exercise covers essential Python concepts, including conditional statements (if-elif-else), loops (for and while), string manipulation, list operations, and iteration with conditions. The tasks demonstrate how to perform fundamental programming operations such as decision-making, iterating over sequences, filtering data types, and breaking loops based on conditions.
These exercises provide a solid foundation for problem-solving in Python, reinforcing concepts commonly used in software development and data processing.
